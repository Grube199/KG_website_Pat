<p>I am a freelance writer who loves writing other people’s stories. I find them fascinating and have written numerous magazine articles of that nature. Currently, I'm working on a memoir.</p>

<p>For more than twenty-five years, I ministered alongside my husband Derek—including pioneering two churches, heading up women’s ministries as well as founding a prayer ministry for mothers of prodigals.</p>

<p>My sense of adventure and insatiable love for travel has taken me to Spain, Israel, Egypt, Switzerland, Amsterdam, Kenya as well as numerous visits to South Africa, my husband’s homeland. Because I believes it’s a crime to go to Africa without going on Safari, this has often been an added adventure.  One day, I hope to visit the Serengeti to experience the Great Migration.</p.

<p>I am a voracious reader and enjoy decorating, knitting, and hosting tea parties. She cherishes quality time with family and friends—especially sharing tea with her great-granddaughters.</p>
